                <h1>Welcome To My Portfolio Website!</h1>
                <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm passionate about building awesome things on the web, and here's a glimpse into my skill set:</p>
                <div className="front-end">
                    <h2>Frontend Development:</h2>
                    <p>I'm fluent in the languages that make websites look cool and interactive - HTML for structure,
                        CSS for styling, and JavaScript for making things move and groove.<br />
                        As a seasoned full-stack web developer, my expertise shines brightest in the realm of front-end components. These are not just tools in my arsenal; they are the building blocks that transform visions into pixel-perfect realities.
                        Let's dive into the world where HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js converge under my expert craftsmanship.</p>
                    <div className="front-end-components">
                        <h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h3>
                        <p>HTML is my playground for building the foundation of web pages. With a keen eye for semantic structure, I create well-organized and accessible content,
                            ensuring a solid base for an exceptional user experience.</p>
                        <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
                        <p>CSS is my artistic palette. I seamlessly blend styles, layouts, and animations to breathe life into web interfaces. Precision is my forte, ensuring pixel-perfect
                            designs and responsive layouts that captivate and engage users across devices.</p>
                        <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
                        <p>JavaScript is where the magic happens. As a scripting maestro, I leverage the power of JS to make web applications dynamic and interactive. From user-friendly forms to seamless navigation,
                            I turn static websites into engaging and responsive experiences.</p>
                        <h3>React.js:</h3>
                        <p>React.js is my toolkit for crafting extraordinary user interfaces. With a declarative approach and component-based architecture, I design scalable and efficient applications. State management? Hooks? JSX elegance?
                            I navigate the React ecosystem with ease, turning complexity into simplicity.</p>
                        <h3>Responsive Design:</h3>
                        <p>I'm not just a coder; I'm a responsive design virtuoso. Crafting experiences that adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and devices is second nature to me. Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries
                            are my tools to ensure a seamless user journey on any device.</p>

                <div className="back-end">
                    <h2>Backend Magic:</h2>
                    <p>"As the architect of digital landscapes, my expertise extends beyond the visible surface. In the backend realm, where data orchestrates the symphony of web applications,
                        I wield tools with finesse. Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB are not just technologies; they are the backbone of the dynamic and robust systems I engineer.
                        Join me as we unravel the intricacies of backend development, where innovation meets functionality."</p>
                    <div className="back-end-components">
                        <h3>Node.js:</h3>
                        <p>Node.js is the powerhouse behind server-side JavaScript. With its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, Node.js allows me to build scalable and high-performance applications. It's not just a runtime;
                            it's the engine that propels real-time, data-intensive, and seamless backend operations.</p>
                        <h3>Express.js:</h3>
                        <p>Express.js is my go-to framework for web applications. Streamlining the creation of robust APIs and web servers, Express.js simplifies routing, middleware handling, and request-response processes.
                            It's the scaffolding that transforms Node.js into a versatile and efficient backend solution.</p>
                        <h3>MongoDB:</h3>
                        <p>MongoDB is the heartbeat of my data management. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
                            Its scalability and dynamic schema make it the perfect companion for agile development. From simple data storage to complex queries,
                            MongoDB is where structured information meets fluid adaptability.</p>

                    <h2>Frameworks and Tools:</h2>
                    <p> Frameworks are pre-built structures that provide a foundation for developing software applications. In web development, frameworks offer a set of standardized practices, 
                        libraries, and tools that streamline the creation of applications. They help developers by providing a scaffold to build upon, reducing the need to write repetitive code. 
                        Popular front-end frameworks include React.js, while Express.js and Django are commonly used for backend development.<br />
                        Tools are software or programs designed to assist developers in various stages of the development process. These can include code editors, version control systems (e.g., Git),
                         task runners (e.g., Gulp, Grunt), and package managers (e.g., npm, yarn). Tools enhance efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and contribute to a smoother workflow. In web development, having a robust set of tools ensures a more productive
                         and organized development experience, from writing code to deploying applications.</p>
